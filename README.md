**5-Way Visualizations**

Write a paragraph for each visualization tool you use. What was easy? Difficult? Where could you see the tool being useful in the future? Did you have to use any hacks or data manipulation to get the right chart?


<u>Altair</u>

<u>d3</u>

I had to increase the right margin in order to ensure that the legend and chart did not overlap


<u>r-ggplot</u>

Issues: it appears that "teal" is not recognized in r, so i had to find the hex code



<u>Excel</u>

Initially I thought that the excel implementation would be the easiest, but it proved to be extremely tedious. A large majority of the work done in excel had to be done manuall; I had to manually add the axis/chart titles, legend titles, colors, and the bill_length_nm lengend in its entirety. To make the bill_length legend, I manually created circles of different sizes and added in a text box with the header and placed it on top of species in the legend area. It is difficult to make small alterations to excel charts, which made this process much longer than it should have been. I also had to manually select each column and range where each data value was being read from. It was easy to have the chart type already defined instead of creating it from scratch, but adding in the data itself was difficult and time consuming. In the past I have prefered to use excel, but that was on small datasets with only 2-3 variables, whereas this visual had 4 variables. I could see excel being useful if you need to make a quick comparison of 2-3 values/variables in a dataset of any size (though it is easier to use on smaller datasets). In the end, I would not use excel again to create a complex chart like this again (this was such a painful process). 


<u>PowerBi</u>

I had never used PowerBi before but I was familiar with Tableau. I found this tool extremely easy and quick to use and understand. This was by far the fastest tool that I used from starting the tool to getting a final product. It is harder to make small changes and personalizations to the charts, but very easy to get quick and intuitive visuals with even large and complex datasets, unlike excel. To match the species colors, I used the teal hex code since that was not an option in the template. However, similarly to excel I had to manually add in the bill_length to the legend area of the chart since this was not an option in the default scatterplot. After research, it does appear that is an option in a "stacked scatter visual from the marketplace", which would be a great option if this was a necessary function for a professional and finalized visual. I would use powerbi again to create a fast and detailed visual of any size dataset that does not require any secific customizations. In the future I know that I will be using this tool for my job and this experiment helped introduce me to the tool and understand how simple it is to use.
